ngsutils - Tools for next-gen sequencing analysis
===
Usage
---
Run the `bamutils`, `bedutils`, `fastqutils`, or `gtfutils` scripts. These are the main driver scripts 
that setup the appropriate environment (loading pysam) and run the requested command.

For ease of use, it is recommended that you add `bamutils`, `bedutils`, `fastqutils`, and `gtfutils` to your $PATH.

Running `bamutils` without any arguments will return a list of commands available.  Running `bamutils command`
will give you the parameters required for that command (or `bedutils`, etc...)

General usage format:

`bamutils command {options} filename`  

`bedutils command {options} filename`  

`fastqutils command {options} filename`  

`gtfutils command {options} filename`  

bamutils

Scripts for manipulating and analyzing BAM files

DNA

* basecall      - Base caller
* minorallele   - Calls minor alleles

RNA

* cims          - Finds regions of unusual deletions (CLIP-Seq)
* rpkm          - Calculates RPKM/counts for genes/regions/repeats (Note: gene counts require a *RefIso* file - see `sequtils` below)

General

* convertregion - Converts region mapping to genomic mapping
* expressed     - Finds regions expressed in a BAM file
* extract       - Extract reads from specific regions (BED)
* filter        - Removes reads from a BAM file based on criteria
* merge         - Merge multiple BAM files together
* reads         - Extract the names of reads and their positions
* split         - Splits a BAM file into smaller pieces
* stats         - Calculates simple stats for a BAM file

Conversions

* tobed         - Convert reads to BED6
* tobedgraph    - Convert reads to BedGraph
* tofasta       - Convert reads to FASTA
* tofastq       - Convert reads to FASTQ


bedutils
---

Scripts for manipulating and creating BED files

General

* extend       - Extends BED regions (3' end)
* reduce       - Merges overlapping BED regions
* refcount     - Given a number of BED files, calculate the number of samples that overlap regions in a reference BED file
* sort         - Sorts a BED file (in place)
* stats        - Calculates simple stats for a BED file

Conversions

* fromprimers  - Converts a list of PCR primer pairs to BED regions
* tobedgraph   - BED to BedGraph
* tofasta      - Extract BED regions from a reference FASTA file


fastqutils
---

Scripts for manipulating and creating FASTQ files

General

* convertqual  - Convert a FASTQ file's quality values from Illumina to Sanger scale
* merge        - Merge paired FASTQ files into one file
* names        - Extract the read names from a FASTQ file
* split        - Split one FASTQ file into N number of smaller files
* stats        - Calculates simple stats for a FASTQ file
* trim         - Remove 5' and 3' linkers from each sequence (uses SW alignment)
* truncate     - Truncate the sequence/qual for all reads to a specific length

Conversions

* fromfasta    - Converts FASTA files (with .qual) to FASTQ (basespace or colorspace)
* fromqseq     - Converts Illumina qseq (or export/sorted) files to FASTQ format
* tofasta      - Converts FASTQ to FASTA


gtfutils
---

Scripts for assembling the gene model used in `bedutils` and `bamutils` scripts. The gene model is similar to the UCSC refFlat or KnownGene
tab-delimited format, except that it adds one column to the beginning indicating isoforms. For some organisms this column can be redundant. 
But for others, it is a required step to ensure annotated isoforms are on the same chromosome and overlap. We are calling this format 
**RefIso**. RefIso files can be compiled from UCSC refFlat or KnownGene files. If needed, these can be automatically downloaded for each 
organism. It is possible that this format will be deprecated in the future.

GTF extra annotations

* add_isoform  - Appends isoform annotation from UCSC isoforms file"
* add_reflink  - Appends isoform/name annotation from RefSeq/refLink"
* add_xref     - Appends name annotation from UCSC Xref file"

General

* genesize     - Extract the sizes of genes from the GTF model (genomic and transcript lengths)
* junctions    - Create a library of potential splice-junctions based upon the GTF model

Conversions

* tobed        - Converts a GFF/GTF model to BED format"


Installing
---

Checkout the code and run `make`. This will create a virtualenv folder (env) and install the needed libraries. The only libraries that are
mandatory are *pysam* and *cython*. Cython requires that the Python headers be present on the system. For a linux system this can be
achieved by installing 'python-devel' or similar.

If you need read-only access use:
`git clone git://github.com/ngsutils/ngsutils.git`

Requires

* Python 2.6+ (including development packages)
* virtualenv

Will install

* pysam
* Cython

Recommended

* samtools
* tabix
