Commands
  DNA-seq
    basecall      - Base/variant caller

  RNA-seq
    count         - Calculates counts/FPKM for genes/BED regions/repeats (also CNV)

  General
    best          - Filter out multiple mappings for a read, selecting only the best
    convertregion - Converts region mapping to genomic mapping
    export        - Export reads, mapped positions, and other tags
    expressed     - Finds regions expressed in a BAM file
    extract       - Extracts reads based on regions in a BED file
    filter        - Removes reads from a BAM file based on criteria
    innerdist     - Calculate the inner mate-pair distance from two BAM files
    junctioncount - Counts the number of reads spanning individual junctions.
    keepbest      - Parses BAM file and keeps the best mapping for reads that have multiple mappings
    merge         - Combine multiple BAM files together (taking best-matches)
    pair          - Given two separately mapped paired files, re-pair the files
    peakheight    - Find the size (max height, width) of given peaks (BED) in a BAM file
    renamepair    - Postprocesses a BAM file to rename pairs that have an extra /N value
    split         - Splits a BAM file into smaller pieces
    stats         - Calculates simple stats for a BAM file
    tag           - Update read names with a suffix (for merging)

  Conversion
    tobed         - Convert BAM reads to BED regions
    tobedgraph    - Convert BAM coverage to bedGraph (for visualization)
    tofasta       - Convert BAM reads to FASTA sequences
    tofastq       - Convert BAM reads back to FASTQ sequences

  Misc
    check         - Checks a BAM file for corruption
    cleancigar    - Fixes BAM files where the CIGAR alignment has a zero length element
