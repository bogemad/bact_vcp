#Input data list,,,,
#Save this file as input_data_list.csv in the bact_vcp directory,,,,
#file_path: Absolute path to fastq files to be used. Best to use absolute file_paths (i.e. /complete/path/to/file) and not the ~ commonly used to designate the home directory,,,,
#Read_group_identifier: Globally unique ID for each flowcell lane. Usually consists of {FLOWCELL_ID}.{LANE_NUMBER}. This data can be found in the fastq file header.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format for more details.,,,,
#Sample: Unique sample name. If you are using multiple fastq files that are of the same sample then use the same sample name.,,,,
"#Platform_technology: Name of platform used for sequencing. Valid names include ILLUMINA, SOLID, LS454, HELICOS and PACBIO.",,,,
"#DNA_preparation_library_identifier: Used to identify the library prep. E.g if you have multiple libaries generated from the same sample, you would include a single sample name but unique library names. If a single library has been sequenced multiple times then the same library and sample names must be used for each fastq generated.",,,,
"#See http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/6472/read-groups for further explanation of the Read group identifier, Sample, Platform/technology, DNA preparation library identifier terms",,,,
